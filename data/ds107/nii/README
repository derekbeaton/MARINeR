General Comments
----------------


Defacing
--------
Pydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects. The code
can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface

Quality Control
---------------
Mriqc was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc. The code can be found
at https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc
